Current challenges # The current state-of-the-art, as developed by large corporations, involves scaling neural networks and training them over an increasingly larger amount of data. We think this standard methodology has many problems:
development of AI solutions is restricted to organizations with the enormous financial means it takes to run those algorithms; the generation of each new AI model produces unacceptable amounts of CO2, the cost of which is born by the entire planet; there is no assurance that intelligence will actually emerge from such systems, as there is no (cognitive) theory supporting the practice of scaling neural systems.</description></item><item><title>Team</title><link>https://ninaris90.github.io/team/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 12:42:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ninaris90.github.io/team/</guid><description>Nina Rismal (CEO) Nina is an economist and political philosopher interested in social change.

Small AI refers to a set of technologies which:
can be run on minimal hardware and infrastructure; is ecologically sustainable; requires significantly less technical expertise; provides agile solutions for a wide variety of problems, in different environments. We work with companies, research organisations and public authorities.
We are based in Brandenburg, Germany.
What we do # Research: We actively bring together scientific disciplines that foster advances in Small AI.</description></item><item><title>Blog</title><link>https://ninaris90.github.io/blog/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:49:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ninaris90.github.io/blog/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Docs</title><link>https://ninaris90.github.io/docs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ninaris90.github.io/docs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://ninaris90.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 19:25:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ninaris90.github.io/contact/</guid><description>For any enquiry about Possible Worlds, please contact Nina at:
