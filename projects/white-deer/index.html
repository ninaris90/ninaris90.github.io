Ideas about what we think might or should happen in the future are a key input into decisions we make in the present. We engage in future thinking continuously, as individuals and as society. At the individual level, it often takes place without any effort, subconsciously, in dreaming, or during the daylight, in daydreaming. Art, too, is a type of future thinking. Not only as science fiction novels and movies, but art as such is an attempt to express something substantially different or intrinsically new, an alternate reality. At the societal level, future thinking is pursued by scientists, above all statisticians, providing important information like weather forecasts and predictions of GDP or sea level rise.</p><p>The imaginary kinds of future thinking tend to be richer and more evocative than predictions of the future that are endorsed as being scientific. The latter, however, are applauded for being relatively more realistic and hence also for being more relevant. One could say that while imagination is capable of conceiving ideas of the future that are truly new, it is supposedly unable to assess their likelihood or feasibility. Science, on the other hand, can generate realistic pictures of the future, but these pictures are not too different from the present. A climate change model might be able to tell us what the likely increases in sea level of air temperature by 2050 are, and perhaps even what effect these increases are to have on a few other aspects of life on Earth, such as habitable space or number of surviving animals from each species. Such a model, however, does not tell us how these increases are to alter some less measurable, yet equally significant features of our reality. What about food production? How might our energy infrastructure look? To what extent might our welfare system be reshuffled? Are there any kinds of future thinking available that would be able to tackle these questions?</p><h2 id=combining-science-with-imagination>Combining science with imagination <a href=#combining-science-with-imagination class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>At Possible Worlds, we are developing models of future thinking which combine science with imagination, giving rise to ideas of the future that are new, but based on scientific methods.</p><p>While news outlets abound with stories about virtual realities, which supposedly reproduce many features of the real world in a digital environment (including estate agents and embassies), the White Deer project is radically different. It does not simply recreate existing patterns in a simulation, but rather lets the user imagine the world in a completely novel way. It does not replicate people as avatars, it allows real individuals to think and experiment with changes that could happen in the real world.</p><p>To achieve this, White Deer acts as an artist, taking in the stimuli of the existing world and reshaping them into something new and surprising. But it also behaves as a scientist, providing a systematic and explainable account of the way their creation came about. The resulting simulation can be visualised and analysed to better understand the consequences of &lsquo;rewriting the world&rsquo;.</p><p>White Deer&rsquo;s algorithm relies on recent advances in machine learning and cognitive science, which highlight similarities between humans and computers. When a person is exposed to the real world, the data contained in that exposure is processed by the brain to construct the concepts and beliefs of that individual. Similarly, a computational system crunches the data it is fed with in order to learn representations of reality. While we cannot so easily change the data contained in the real world, it is possible to manipulate the input to a machine, in a way that it seems exposed to a different &lsquo;reality&rsquo;. White Deer does just that, using text corpora as input data.</p><h2 id=features>Features <a href=#features class=anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p><strong>Innovative:</strong> White Deer does not suggest mere extensions to our existing reality, but generates novel alternatives to our social and economic structures.</p><p><strong>Transformative:</strong> The system is not another mode of escapism. It concerns itself with ways to improve life on the planet we know.</p><p><strong>Systemic:</strong> The algorithm allows users to explore how changes to only one aspect of reality has consequences for all others.</p></article></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer text-muted"><div class=container-xxl><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 order-last order-lg-first"><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item>Powered by <a class=text-muted href=https://www.netlify.com/>Netlify</a>, <a class=text-muted href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, and <a class=text-muted href=https://getdoks.org/>Doks</a>.
