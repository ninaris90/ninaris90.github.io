It is our strong belief that the AI of the future will be based on science, rather than ad-hoc methods. We strive to simulate the most precious aspects of human cognition: the ability to explain, understand and imagine. Our strategy is to combine cutting-edge research in cognitive science and computational modelling to develop new types of algorithms.
