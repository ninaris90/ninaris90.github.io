## Who we are

Possible Worlds is an enterprise specialising in small AI. 

Small AI refers to a set of technologies with the following features:
 
- it can be run on minimal hardware and infrastructure;
- it is ecologically sustainable;
- it requires significantly less technical expertise.


We work with individuals, companies and research organisations. We are based in Brandenburg, Germany. 




## What we do

* **Research:** We actively bring together scientific disciplines that foster advances in Small AI.

* **Develop:** We turn scientific insights into AI models, and share them through open source licenses.

* **Deploy:** We apply our models to different causes, from everyday applications to the big societal questions of our time. 







* Visions & scenarios 
We create prototypes of the future. 

* Toolkits 
We develop AI-based toolkits for everyone's use. For play and for work. Be it SME or individuals: creatives and enterpreneurs. AI can assist you in different ways. For example, it can help you to [...] But it can also solve other tasks such as image recognition, question answering and text classification (needs to be explained). Our toolkits include everything you need to get started with a task: use cases, models, datasets, and more! 

* Workshops & courses
We design and lead tailored workshops and courses on AI. 

* Consultation
We offer bespoke advice on the use of AI. 

** Basic research 
We work on advancing the science that underpinns and builds on AI.
