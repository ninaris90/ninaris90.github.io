Possible Worlds is a research and educational enterprise specialising in small AI. 
We learn about, teach and develop AI technology used: 
- by everyone (also the anti-tech crowds); 
- anywhere (even in places with bad broadband infrastructure); 
- with miniumum hardware requirements (such as Rasberry Pi, or other very basic computer); 
- for different causes (from helping with mundane tasks to addressing the big societal questions). 

We work with individuals, companies and research organisations. We are based in Brandeneburg, Germany.
