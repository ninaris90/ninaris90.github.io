At Possible Worlds Inc. we research, create and interpret possible worlds - nonexistent and not yet existent ones - utilising AI and insights from social sciences, humanities and the arts.

A ‘possible world’ is a technical term in linguistics describing a complete and consistent way the world is or could have been.

We are a research-driven company, supported by our sister company, Possible Worlds Research.
