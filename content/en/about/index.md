At Possible Worlds, we believe in the power of AI to enhance human creativity. Our mission is to build systems that support innovation in all corners of society. We strive to empower small businesses and creators. We also provide policy-makers with tools to imagine different futures. To achieve our goal, we actively integrate AI research and development with insights from social science, politics and the arts. We dream of a world where the world can truly be reinvented, and where technology supports the fundamental human drive for change.
