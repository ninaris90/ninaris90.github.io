Possible Worlds is a research and educational enterprise specialising in small AI. 
We develop AI technologies that can be used: 
- by everyone (even by tech skeptics); 
- anywhere (even in places with bad broadband infrastructure); 
- with minimum hardware requirements (on single-board computers such as the [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.com/)); 
- for different causes (from mundane tasks to the big societal questions of today). 

We work with individuals, companies and research organisations. We are based in Brandenburg, Germany.
