We use generative AI agents to deliver market insights to product vendors, giving them insight today into the possible worlds of tomorrow. 

We have built Simulatrex, an open-source project focused on Generative Agent-Based Modeling, utilizing large language models for more accurate simulations. It's designed for researchers and developers interested in exploring human behavior and social dynamics.
