## The problem with recommender systems

The ability to provide recommendations is the common denominator of all large Internet companies. Whether their suggestions involve books, movies, washing machines, friends, or simply Web pages, the likelihood that they will retain their audience is correlated with the quality of their recommendation engine.

Typically, recommendation happens in a silo (Amazon does not recommend Netflix and vice versa). It also relies on algorithms that are often privacy-damaging and based on dubious principles (for instance, the idea that if you are friend with someone, you will like the same movies).

Possible Worlds is developing *Toppix*, a single recommendation platform for narratives -- whether movies, novels, fiction podcasts, theatre, opera. The software will be available in dozens of languages, ensuring that stories from the entire world can be shared on a global level. It does not rely on personal data collection, focusing instead on actual content. It does not require any expensive hardware, so that small and medium businesses can integrate it into their workflow.


## Working out a solution

The first version of Toppix is made of a pipeline of AI tools that perform an in-depth analysis of movie synopses, including the main characters, events and locations in the story. To achieve this, it builds on the tools Possible Worlds has been developing in their [Garden of AI](projects/garden-ai).





### Features

**Privacy-respecting:** The dominant recommendation algorithms are based on the centralised collection on personal data: what consumers have bought, what they have liked on social media, what their friends have bought / liked, what 'similar' people are interested in. Instead, Toppix is 100% content-based.
