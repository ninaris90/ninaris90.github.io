## The problem with artificial intelligence

Agriculture started 12,000 ago when humans understood that a wonder of nature -- plant growth -- could be harnessed to their advantage. Many centuries later, humans are slowly understanding that another natural phenomenon, *cognition*, can similarly be 'grown' and used to benefit work and social processes. Simulating cognition is the promise of Artificial Intelligence.

Unlike agriculture, though, the practice of AI is currently reserved to a handful of the world's population. It requires special knowledge and special tools, which are out of reach for most people. While our ancestors could partake in the development of agriculture by collecting (freely available) seeds and planting them in (freely available) soil, the development of AI is very much an ivory tower activity.

Possible Worlds is committed to make AI a truly shared human activity. We want everyone, everywhere, to be able to take part in the AI revolution. Just like in the natural world, we want seeds to lie around, ready to be collected by budding farmers. We want land to be available to those who need it. We want people to experiment, learn, and share their skills and produces.


## Working out a solution

Farming requires three ingredients: soil, water, and seeds. Similarly, AI has some basic needs: hardware that will run computations according to a predefined algorithm, data that the program can learn from, and the algorithm itself.

*Hardware (the soil)*: Most AI is currently run on expensive hardware, which small organisations and individuals cannot afford. In contrast, the Possible Worlds technology is developed to run on the cheapest available computers on the market: single-board computers (e.g. the Raspberry PI).

*Data (water)*: Data collection is an intensive process that necessitates very specific skills and access to dedicated servers. Possible Worlds is developing a series of tools to facilitate data preparation.

*Algorithms (the seeds)*: The algorithm is what people usually refer to when they talk of an 'AI'. Right now, the most successful AI algorithms fall under the concept of 'Deep Learning', i.e. very large and complex neural networks which require huge resources in terms of hardware, data, and expert knowledge. Possible Worlds is rebuilding AI, one step at a time, to make it run on small hardware and small data. Because we believe that intelligence is about doing much with nothing. To achieve our goal, we extensively rely on insights in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience and theoretical linguistics. Because we believe that the AI of tomorrow will be based on science, not on size.


## Features

**100% RPI-compatible:** All our AI components are tested on single-board computers, to ensure they will work on low-level hardware. In practice, we test each component on Raspberry Pis, model 4, 4-8GB RAM. 


**100% eco-friendly:** We record the CO2 emissions of each AI component before releasing it, so that users are fully aware of their footprint.
