A tool to simulate new futures. 

## The problem with the “new”

Thinking about the future is an activity vital to human life. Ideas about what we think might or should happen in the future are a key input into decisions we make in the present. We engage in it continuously, as individuals and as society. At the individual level, it often takes place without any effort, subconsciously, in dreaming, or during the daylight, in daydreaming. Art, too, is a type of future thinking. Not only as science fiction novels and movies, but art as such is an attempt to express something substantially different or intrinsically new, an alternative reality. At the societal level, future thinking is pursued by scientists, above all statisticians, providing important information like weather forecasts and predictions of GDP or sea level rise. 

The imaginary kinds of future thinking tend to be richer and more evocative than predictions of the future that are endorsed as being scientific. The latter, however, are applauded for being relatively more realistic and hence also for being more relevant. One could say that while imagination is capable of conceiving ideas of the future that are truly new, it is supposedly unable to assess their likelihood or feasibility. Science, on the other hand, can generate realistic pictures of the future, but these pictures are not too different from the present. A climate change model might be able to tell us what the likely increases in sea level of air temperature by 2050 are, and perhaps even what effect these increases are to have on a few other aspects of life on Earth, such as habitable space or number of surviving animals from each species, but such a model does not tell us how these increases are to alter some less measurable, yet equally significant features of our reality. What about food production? How might our energy infrastructure look? To what extent might our welfare system be redesigned? 

There are however other kinds of future thinking which we have not learned how to master yet. This is the type of thinking that is concerned with futures that we would like to see, futures that we would like to live in, futures that we would like to create. Like forecasting this thinking considers what could be, and like dreaming, it probes into what we might wish for, combining methods of science with those of imagination, giving rise to something that is new, new futures and new worlds. 


## Combining science with imagination 

At Possible Worlds, we are developing models of future thinking which combines science with imagination, giving rise to ideas of the future that are new, but based on widely acceptable scientific methods. 

While news outlets abound with stories about virtual realities, which supposedly reproduce many features of the real world in a digital environment (including estate agents and embassies), the White Deer project is radically different. It does not simply recreate existing patterns in a simulation, but rather lets the user imagine the world in a completely novel way. It does not replicate people as avatars, it allows real individuals to think and experiment with changes that could happen in the real world.

To achieve this, White Deer analyses how the data people are exposed to shapes their concepts and beliefs in the current world. It also provides tools to manipulate the real data -- adding, removing, and modifying existing ideas, with the goal of simulating a human exposed to radically different beliefs. The system acts as an artist, taking in the stimuli of the existing world and reshaping them into something new and surprising. But it also behaves as a scientist, providing a systematic and explainable account of the way their creation came about.  The resulting simulation can be visualised and analysed to better understand the consequences of 'rewriting the world'.


[comment]: # (it can be new but it is not realistic or possible or it can be realistic and possible but it is now new. !! thinking how a future can be different, new, as opposed to an extension of the present. The output can be analysed in terms of the most likely associations a human would draw between concepts. A possible extension for the system would be to train a dialogue agent on the data rather than simply learn concepts. The resulting agent could then chat with human users.)
