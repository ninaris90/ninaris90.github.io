## The problem with resource allocation 

Extreme levels of inequality in our society, exploding climate crisis and interrupted supply chains testify to the claim that our economy is broken.  Markets are not distributing products and services in a way that would be beneficial for the society as a whole. Instead they appear to be skewed to benefiting certain minorities. Markets have also not succeeded in guaranteeing sufficient supply of essential public goods such as health care and education. Moreover, while they have managed to satisfy other basic needs, such as for heating and electricity, they have done so only in the short-term and at high expense of the long-term. The most recent failure of the market economy is the ongoing interruptions of supply chains, neither end-consumers nor the tech-manufacturers have been able to purchase all chips and other components they require, either for their personal uses or as inputs into further production processes. While policy makers have worked hard to mitigate these issues, the real fixes are yet to be found. 


## Working out a solution

Pomona is an AI-driven algorithm tasked with distributing resources within a given economy. Such an economy is best conceptualised as a network of agents, some of whom are producers, some consumers, and some both. Pomona’s first job is information collection. It gathers information on the needs of consumers, on the one side, and on the available resources supplied by producers, on the other side. Subject to principles that are decided upon externally, Pomona calculates the most optimal distribution of resources. 

It is important to note that Pomona is not dealing with the production side of the economy per se, as for example, a centrally planned economy would, where production decisions on what is produced and in what quantitates, are made by a single agent, such as the state. In Pomona’s economy, the supply side functions, more or less in the same way as it has functioned so far. There are multiple firms, entrepreneurs,  craftspeople, service-providers, who continue operating as they have until now, churning out computers, baguettes, therapy sessions, or whatever else their product has been. The only difference to the supply side in the market setting is that under Pomona producers receive an explicit and precise feedback on whether there is a lack or a surplus of a certain good in the economy as a whole. In a market setting too, producers receive certain feedbacks, but these are usually only partial and less precise. For example, from their stock levels, individual producers easily notice to what extent they are meeting customers demand, but obtaining this piece of information for the sector as a whole is much more difficult. Pomona, however, does have this ability, since it collects information on individual stock levels from the whole economy, and is thus able to calculate the overall over- or under-stocks. On the basis of this information, firms may thus adjust their production decisions.

## Features

**Resilient:** The system has been trained on millions of possible configurations of consumers needs and stock levels, including some that seem highly unlikely. 

**Neutral:** The system does not presuppose any prior sets of political beliefs. Users can adapt Pomona to implement any policy programme of their choice.
